The Interview Question that started it all.

While answering a series of interview questions, I realized that one of the problems stood out.
It was quite different.
I had to tinker and think over solutions after testing a bit.
It was probably the best technical interview question I have ever had because it was more than a knowledge check.
It stuck with me so much, I would like to share the evolution of my solutions.
